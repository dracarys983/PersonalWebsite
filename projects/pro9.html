<p> Designed the geometry API functions necessary for realizing the generic approach for finding Surface Area, Volume and Centroid for primitives which don’t have specific mathematical approaches, having raytracing at it’s centrepiece. Implemented their respective caller functions in the C++ interface for geometry analysis.
