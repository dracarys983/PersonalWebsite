<h2 class="section-title" style="text-align:center"> Cue guiding for 8-ball pool </h2> <!-- Add GitHub link? -->
<hr class="style-two top-rule" />
<p> Developed a program that, given a top-down pool table image with random cue, finds the position of pockets and balls using binarization & template matching and visualizes the post-impact vectors to predict the possible shots.
