title: "Backgammon AI"
description: "Designed a reasonably intelligent AI bot that plays BackGammon using techniques like Running Game, Holding Game and the Back Game strategy, along with heuristics to guide the choice of the best move. The move prediction tree is made only one-level deep as going beyond that exceeds the available memory on architectures used in day-to-day life"

<p> Designed a reasonably intelligent AI bot that plays BackGammon using techniques like Running Game, Holding Game and the Back Game strategy, along with heuristics to guide the choice of the best move. The move prediction tree is made only one-level deep as going beyond that exceeds the available memory on architectures used in day-to-day life.
