<p> Developed a Compiler for Decaf (a subset of C programming language) which uses Bison / Flex as frontend and LLVM as backend. While parsing, an abstract syntax tree is built which generates the LLVM Bitcode upon traversal. The LLVM interpreter generates assembly code from the Bitcode, which is then compiled using g++/gcc/clang/clang++ to generate the executable binary.
