<p> So, after keeping it pending for a long, long time, I finally started to build my Personal Website from scratch. I always wanted to build my website without using any existing template, though I didn't mind using an idea or two from them. All I wanted was to get down and dirty with the CSS of my website and build something beautiful on my own. Here is the journey that I embarked while attempting to make my personal website : </p>

<p> As any layman in this area would do, I googled for <em>"Build a personal website from scratch"</em> and I was offered with a lot of alternatives. And again, as most of us who are really curious would do, I opened up the first link right away. It led me <a style="font-size: calc(16px + 0.5vw)" class="simple-link" href="https://builtvisible.com/hand-coding-personal-website/">here</a> and I found it quite interesting. Caveats (ooh, did I tell you I love them?), Boilerplates and Grids -- I
was loving this journey already. I was so excited that I cloned the boilerplate repo from GitHub, started working on it right away and then I start setting up an Apache server on my Mac for testing locally. Just for the record, it took me 5 days to set up this website with the current design and functionalities. </p>
