<p> Hello, folks! </p>
<p> I always wanted to share my thoughts by writing a blog on my personal website. However, I did not have a personal website until a week ago and hence, here I start my blogging journey. Since I was a kid, I have loved creative writing and propogating influential thoughts. It hasn't been till now that I found the platform and motivation to do so in front of a wide audience. I'm here to learn the art of giving my thoughts a form; giving them shape and moulding them into words that I can share with the rest of the world. </p>
