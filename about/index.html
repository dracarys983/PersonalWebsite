<p> I am currently a Master's student enrolled in a dual-degree program, at International Institute Of Information Technology, Hyderabad. I completed my four years of B.Tech in April '16. </p>
<p> I am pursuing research in the field of Deep Learning and Computer Vision. Previously, I have worked in the field of heterogeneous (including both GPU and CPU) string sorting algorithms. Details about my work on string sorting algorithm that got accepted at HiPC Student Research Symposium, 2016, can be found <a href="../projects#stringsort">here</a>. </p>
<p> My dream is to bring a change through teaching and hence, a career in academia. I want to become the best Professor this world has ever seen. The inspiration and motivation behind this aspiration is one of my teachers in high school. </p>
<p> I love playing soccer to an extent that it was my first career choice when I was 9. Well, that's a reason why I am never going to stop playing. I love creative but classy graphic designs, writing blogs, cooking food, travelling around the world and meeting new people. Being a Gujarati, I love celebrating festivals. </p>
